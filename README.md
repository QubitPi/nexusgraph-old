__Nexus Graph is under active development and will become online as soon as it's ready__.

The world is complex and fast-changing; we feel little control of it. We need a tool that helps us navigate through
challenges, such as tackling hard problems, lie detection, and connecting effectively with others. Nexus Graph
revolutionizes our daily "ritual" such as reading, analyzing, and knowledge exploration, to make our lives more
controllable.
