The following guide is intended for developers who want to make changes to the Nexus Graph. It will cover the design of
various subsystems.

Module Layout
-------------

Elide is a [mono-repo](https://qubitpi.github.io/monorepo.tools/) consisting of the following published modules:

| Module Name      | Description                                                       |
|------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|
| nexusgraph-app   | The user interface where user can use all features of Nexus Graph |
| nexusgraph-db    | Graph Data storage for nexusgraph CRUD API queries                |
| nexusgraph-graph | The core module that handles Graph rendering                      |
| nexusgraph-nlp   | The AI module that transforms text/audio into knowledge graphs    |
| nexusgraph-oauth | Handles Authentication                                            |
| nexusgraph-redux | The state management of the entire app                            |

High Level Design
-----------------

The following diagram represents a high level component breakout of Nexus Graph. Names in italics represent class names
whereas other names represent functional blocks (made up of many classes). Gray arrows represent module dependencies
through the system.

Dependency Injection
--------------------

In order to optimize our developer's experience, Nexus Graph runs against very different configurations in
Dev/Test/Prod environments. This puts some challenges on the design of system. Dependency injection is one of them.
For example, in dev mode, we want our UI engineer to go completely free by decoupling backend developments. We do that
by running in-memory backend services. This means for those services, we need to automatically wire up different
implementations in Dev and Prod environment.

To address that, we use [Inversify] to dynamically load 2 of our components:

1. AI Entity Extraction Service
2. Graph API Webservice

Redux Module
------------

We are not using [Redux Toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.qubitpi.org/) because we want greater control over our
application states

We employ redux by defining a GlobalState and a bunch of slices, which include reduces, to manipulate these states.

The module also maintains the domain model of a "Graph" which includes 3 representations:

1. A [Node][Graph Node]
2. A [Link][Graph Link]
3. A [Graph][Graph]

Basically, all Nexus Graph components agree on such data structure to model a graph. If a different representation is
needed, such as in nexusgraph-graph module, where a node needs to encode its position on a graph canvas, a
[separate transformation](https://nexusgraph.qubitpi.org/api/functions/nexusgraph_graph_src_mappers.mapToBasicNodes.html)
would be needed

Please keep in mind that Nexus Graph uses intensively 2 of the Redux's recommended practices:

1. [Selector Functions][Redux Action Creators]
2. [Action Creators][Redux Selector Functions]

Graph Module
------------

Our graph model is deeply nested, which causes a
[huge pain on Redux state update](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/62373936/component-not-updating-on-deeply-nested-redux-object).
We take an
[immutable approach](https://redux.qubitpi.org/usage/structuring-reducers/immutable-update-patterns/#immutable-update-utility-libraries)
to address such issue.

Database Module
---------------

Nexus Graph is storage agnostic.

Semantic layer: `GraphClient`.

Our free version comes with an in-memory [json-graphql-server]. We can host our own on-premise production version with
[astraios.io], our official supported backend for storing graphs. Or we can implement our own [graph API](#graph-api)

### json-graphql-server

```bash
cd nexusgraph
yarn start:graph-api
```

The server will be running at `http://localhost:5000/`.

:::tip

There is a very useful debugging technique: if you click the axios request to the server from browser console, it will
take you directly to the `http://localhost:5000/` with the actual query printed on it, ready to be re-sent for debugging
purposes.

### Graph API

#### Separating Database's Primary Key and Business Object Identifier

Each Node/Link/Graph is stored in database with a primary key. In Nexus Graph, however, we always use a [natural key]
next to the primary key to identify between nodes and links. For example, if there are the following 2 nodes with a
connecting link:

|    Entity    | Primary Key | Natural Key | Source Node Key | Target Node |
|:------------:|:-----------:|:-----------:|:---------------:|:-----------:|
| Source Node  |   154436    | __hs7YGDf__ |       N/A       |     N/A     |
| Target Node  |   634741    | __3rIH83f__ |       N/A       |     N/A     |
|     Link     |    27256    |   df09%HI   |   __hs7YGDf__   | __3rIH83f__ |

The two nodes (Source Node and Target Node) are connected by the two Natural Keys: `hs7YGDf` & `3rIH83f` instead of
`154436` & `634741`, because ID's are fragile. We cannot really rely on them not changing. When we choose to move to
another database platform, or a new version of the current platform, and we want to move all data using
[`INSERT`](https://www.w3schools.com/sql/sql_insert.asp) statements, it is possible to lose the ID fields.

Nexus Graph uses [UUID](https://www.npmjs.com/package/uuid) to generate the natural key on client side and then persists
it to database.

The database primary key in Nexus Graph is only used to distinguish a CREATE and UPDATE operation. If an object
(node/link/graph) already exists (based on the provided primary key value) then it will be updated. Otherwise, it will
be created.
