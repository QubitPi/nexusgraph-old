We are in an era where any knowledge is never simple anymore. For example, when we read a book, we branch off to
various topics and somewhere along the way we jump back to the book. This is best modeled by knowledge graph

Welcome to nexusgraph's documentation hub! We're still building out documentation on many aspects of nexusgraph, but
here you'll find what documentation we do have. To make it easier to find the help you need, we've broken the
documentation down into a few categories, but if you can't find what you're looking for, please don't hesitate to
[create an issue][create issue]

[nexusgraph's documentation][documentation] is written using [Docusaurus][Docusaurus]. The documentation source code is
located at [/docs][documentation source] directory. You can find everything about using nexusgraph, including how to
start an instance of it, troubleshooting, and architecture overview.

In addition, to make development of nexusgraph a better experience, we've also documented our internal components using
TypeDoc. Developers of nexusgraph can find useful info at ourAPI documentation page
