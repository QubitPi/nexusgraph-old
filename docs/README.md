nexusgraph Documentation
========================

This website is built using [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/), a modern static website generator.

Installation
------------

```bash
yarn
```

Local Development
-----------------

```bash
yarn start
```

This command starts a local development server and opens up a browser window. Most changes are reflected live without
having to restart the server.

### Translation

Nexus Graph documentation comes with [internationalization][Docusaurus i18n] supporting both **English** and
**Chinese**. The location of Chinese translation is in [i18n/zh-cn](../docs/i18n/zh-cn) directory

To start the localized site in dev mode, use:

```bash
cd docs
yarn install
yarn start --locale zh-cn
```

Your site is accessible at `http://localhost:3000/nexusgraph/zh-cn/`

Build
-----

```bash
yarn build
```

This command generates static content into the `build` directory and can be served using any static contents hosting
service. Docusaurus will build one single-page application per locale:

- **build**: for the default, English language
- **build/zh-cn**: for the Chinese language

A [TypeDoc][TypeDoc]-autogenerated directory, called `api`, will also be generated under the `build` directory as part
of the build. When nexusgraph documentation is deployed onto GitHub Pages, the API will [also be served][API]

[API]: https://docs.nexusgraph.com/api

[Docusaurus i18n]: https://docusaurus.io/docs/next/i18n/tutorial
